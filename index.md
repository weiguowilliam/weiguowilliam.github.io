## About Me


I'm a Ph.D. student in the Intelligent Aerospace Systems Lab (IASL) advised by Professor [Peng Wei](https://web.seas.gwu.edu/pwei/) and Professor [Rober Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/). I’m interested in deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms in safety-critical decision making systems. My current research is focused on developing deep reinforcement learning approaches for collision avoidance and motion planning.

## Research Interests

- **Methods:** Deep Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Convex Optimization, Natural Language Processing
- **Focused Applications:** Safety in Learning-based Planning and Control, Safety Verification for Deep Reinforcement Learning

## News

- **[July 2021]** Our paper about safety enhancement in autonomous separation assurance is accepted to [ITSC 2021](https://2021.ieee-itsc.org/).
- **[Apr. 2021]** Our paper about semantic bias in neural language models is accepted to [AIES 2021](https://www.aies-conference.com/2021/) and selected for the [oral presentation](https://slideslive.com/38956056/detecting-emergent-intersectional-biases-contextualized-word-embeddings-contain-a-distribution-of-humanlike-biases).
- **[Jan. 2021]** Our paper about characterizing biases on Twitter is accepted to [ICSC 2021](https://semanticcomputing.wixsite.com/icsc2021).
