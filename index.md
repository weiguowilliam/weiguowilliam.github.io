## About Me


I currently serve as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, where my passion and expertise in safe and trustworthy machine learning. In 2023, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from George Washington University. My doctoral journey was enriched by the guidance and mentorship of Professors [Peng Wei](https://web.seas.gwu.edu/pwei/) and Professor [Robert Pless](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/). My research is now dedicated to advancing natural language processing techniques, with a specific focus on enhancing the safety and trustworthiness of machine learning systems.

## Research Interests

- **Methods:** Natural Language Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Statistical Machine Learning 
- **Focused Applications:** Trustworthy Natural Langauge Processing, Safety Verification for Deep Reinforcement Learning
